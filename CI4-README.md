## Steps for configuring xampp

    1. On the xampp control panel, open config, select 'httpd.config'
    2. CTRL+f 'AllowOverride'. Deafult setting = 'none'. Set to = 'All'.
    3. CTRL+f 'mod_rewrite.so' to find this line 'LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so' 
    4. Uncomment this line by removing the '#' at the start of the line.
    4. Save and restart apache.

## Testing your endpoints

    base url = 'http://localhost/CI4-EcoTrack/public/'
    example endpoint = 'http://localhost/CI4-EcoTrack/public/users'

## Define your endpoints in app/config/Routes.php

    $routes->get('users', 'UserController::index');

    'users' = my custom path
    'UserController' = the name the controller you want to access
    'index' = the name of the method you want to access

## How to clear the cache

    clear the cache using a spark command
    
    1. On the top bar of VSCode, click Terminal > New Terminal
    2. run this command in the terminal = php spark cache:clear 

    It is a good idea to clear the cache and restart apache whenever the .env file is edited

## What is CodeIgniter?

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible and secure.
More information can be found at the [official site](https://codeigniter.com).

This repository holds a composer-installable app starter.
It has been built from the
[development repository](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4).

More information about the plans for version 4 can be found in [CodeIgniter 4](https://forum.codeigniter.com/forumdisplay.php?fid=28) on the forums.

You can read the [user guide](https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/)
corresponding to the latest version of the framework.

## Installation & updates

`composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter` then `composer update` whenever
there is a new release of the framework.

When updating, check the release notes to see if there are any changes you might need to apply
to your `app` folder. The affected files can be copied or merged from
`vendor/codeigniter4/framework/app`.

## Setup

Copy `env` to `.env` and tailor for your app, specifically the baseURL
and any database settings.

## Important Change with index.php

`index.php` is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the *public* folder,
for better security and separation of components.

This means that you should configure your web server to "point" to your project's *public* folder, and
not to the project root. A better practice would be to configure a virtual host to point there. A poor practice would be to point your web server to the project root and expect to enter *public/...*, as the rest of your logic and the
framework are exposed.

**Please** read the user guide for a better explanation of how CI4 works!

## Repository Management

We use GitHub issues, in our main repository, to track **BUGS** and to track approved **DEVELOPMENT** work packages.
We use our [forum](http://forum.codeigniter.com) to provide SUPPORT and to discuss
FEATURE REQUESTS.

This repository is a "distribution" one, built by our release preparation script.
Problems with it can be raised on our forum, or as issues in the main repository.
